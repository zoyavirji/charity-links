        Coronavirus is a family of viruses that can affect humans and animals. They’re structure is a sphere with spikes of protein surrounding it to 
        infect healthy cells. These spikes also allow the body to acknowledge its presence which then causes the symptoms to show. Because the form of 
        this virus replicated a crown, it is named "corona" meaning crown in Latin. It is said that the virus originated from a bat but this has not yet 
        been proved to be true.`,

Once this   tragic event occurred, many people around the world set up protests to voice their anger with the issue of racism that has    yet to be solved after hundreds of years. Of course during the pandemic large gatherings were discouraged, however, personal protective equipment was worn for   those who attended. For the rest of the month of May and almost all of June, hashtags and posts were trending to spread       awareness of the terrible acts of racism in the last 20 years. Currently, online petitions and donations are the most         impactful way to help make change and to encourage local authorities to sentence the police who kill black people without     reason.",

Moments after the explosion on the 4th of August 2020, witnesses who were interviewed described the explosion as powerful     and like a shock. The explosion was supposedly caused by ammonium nitrate which was stored for 6 years in the port of         Beirut. The Lebanese government confiscated the ammonium nitrate from an abandoned ship and stored it unsafely for the past   6 years. A few days later, both the Lebanese cabinet and Prime Minister resigned from their duties because of the large       catastrophe created by this explosion.",
